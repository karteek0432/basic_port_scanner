# 🔍 Port Scanner — A Simple Python Project

Hey there! 👋  
This is a **basic but powerful TCP port scanner** written in Python. It helps you find open ports on any target IP address or domain, and even tells you what kind of services are running on those ports (like HTTP, SSH, etc.).

I made this as part of my learning in cybersecurity 🛡️ and ethical hacking 🧠.
